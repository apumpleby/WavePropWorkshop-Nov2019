    "\n",
    "**• Beware of types!**  \n",
    "– E.g. it happens to not make any difference for this case if `length`, `depth` & `dx` are int or float, but it *could* do. However, if I'd set `vmax=1520` below, rather than `vmax=1520.0` (i.e. so it's an int rather than float), and then created `c` by filling it with `vmax`, it turns out that `c` is *an integer array, and stays that way even during the loops that fill in the gradient*.\n",
    "\n",
    "**• Compact is good!**  \n",
    "– When using a double-loop (e.g. as the first method below), it can be important to try to make code within the loops as compact as you can in order to avoid compute time increasing. Practically, that means precalculating anything you can that stays fixed during the loops (see below where I've precalculated `f`, `a` & `b`). For such a small simulation as used here, it's going to be less of an issue, but even so, if you have a long expression within the double-loop (e.g. you put in the full expressions for `a` & `b` in terms of `nx`, `nz` & `vdiff`), you'll notice the difference it makes to how long it takes to run the cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "**• Separate task specifications from other code!**  \n",
    "– It can often be worthwhile to set up variables that contain some of the basic specs you've been given in the task. And then you can use those vars in the rest of your coding such that if you're asked to change the spec in some way (e.g. to create a gradient with different start/end speeds) then you only have to change those vars, and then, to fulfil the new task, all the rest of your coding Just Works™ :)  \n",
    "As a simple example, note how the values 1520.0 and 820.0 only appear once (each) in the code below (assigned to `vmax` and used to find `vdiff`). Everything else is then written using those vars, so I can easily change it all simply by changing those values in *one* place in the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**• Beware of nested loops!**  \n",
    "– Further than just compacting code within loops, it's better if you can avoid using nested loops at all. Doing things across at least one whole dimension of a multi-dimensional array will improve efficiency. (See the second method in the coding cell below for an example.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**• But conversely, beware of unecessary large temporary arrays!**  \n",
    "– One of the potential pitfalls of trying to do things across the whole of a multi-dimensional array in one go (i.e. trying to avoid doing even a single loop over one dimension) is that it can easily mean creating temporary arrays in order to perform multi-dimensional array operations on multiple arrays to lead to final value(s) that you want to calculate. Doing this may very well help with performance (since it operates on whole arrays without the extra overheads of parsing & running the loop code) - and it's certainly no problem for the small cases given here - but if the arrays become much larger (e.g. moving to 3d, with hundreds of gridpoints in every dimension) then it can start to 'suck' away memory without you realising (until your machine slows to a crawl...)\n",

Similarly, decrease the time-step to the actual expected 'best' of ~4.65ms (and even try some below that), and see how the results compare (i.e. the wavefields, and the RMS values in task 9). You'll find that it doesn't make that much difference what time-step you choose, until it reaches the point where it becomes unstable as the step size increases a little beyond the 4.7ms originally given by this task – and then it 'blows up' very quickly (i.e. the results head towards infinity).\n",

    "– The `src` array is small here, so it really makes little difference how compact/efficient the code is (as long as it ends up filled it as required!), but it's no bad thing to get into the habit.  \n",
    "– It's easy to think it's worth creating an array for the amplitude (or even creating two arrays, one with ramp, one with fixed value, and then concatenating), and then use that to fill in the `src` array. But if you then use a loop to set the values in `src`, there really was no point to having such temporary amplitude arrays –you can just build `src` straight away in a loop, with a simple expression to premultiply to get the ramp, and avoid having any extra arrays at all!\n",

    "**• Beware cases that could fail!**  \n",
    "– The second method I give below has a potential issue that will cause it to fail when the function input takes certain values (and they are values which are not beyond reasonable expectation -it's not unreasonable for the function to get called with `ns<100`). It's worth showing that you've noticed/taken-account such things, either by including some kind of error message for such cases, or by rewriting the code to deal with it.\n",

Dispersion is not something you can avoid – there will always be some dispersion. But it gets worse as the freqs in the src increase, generally leading to a decrease in accuracy during the simulation. OTOH, violation of the CFL condition is generally catastrophic for a simulation (and accuracy does not change much whilst staying anywhere within the CFL constraint).\n",

This is very often a decent guide to the freqs we should allow in our src wavelet, but it can, on occasion, be a bit misleading if you don't take account of where the minimum speeds are located in the model.

    "#### • The obstruction...\n",
    "\n",
    "There are essentially two straightforward ways to create the obstruction – I think everyone used one of them, and a handful even included code (usually commented out) for the 'other' method (i.e. the one they didn't actually use).\n",
    "\n",

    "– zero the propagation speed along the obstruction, i.e. `c[:,od]=0.0` (or make it very slow, e.g. 1.0).\n",
    "\n",
    "Both of the above have potential drawbacks: the first requires a little extra computation at every time-step (though it is relatively small), while the second means 'losing' some information (i.e. the values of the propagation speed within the domain) that may be needed at some point later. –For this simple case, though, neither of these are of any concern.\n",

    "  \n",
    "#### • The hole in the obstruction...\n",

    "\n",
    "– misinterpreting exactly what the task was asking (i.e. that the holes should have 71 grid-points *of obstruction between* them, not just 71 grid-points from left hole centre to right hole centre);  \n",
    "– forgetting exactly how python ranges work (so ending up off by one, making the holes not symmetric either side of the middle, or making them only 6 grid-points, etc.). Remember that the values given in a python array range are *NOT* symmetric: the left side of the range is included, but the right side is not – i.e. `a[m:n]` includes `a[m]` but *not* `a[n]`!\n",

Also note that it is quite reasonable to miss out the first and last gridpoints for the obstruction and the predictive boundary above it, since those gridpoints are also set for the new wavefield by the predictive boundary conditions around the edges.

    "– working out the value for new wavefield from the wrong layers of earlier wavefield (should be `od-1` & `od-2` -see code below);  \n",

    "\n",
    "#### • Calculating RMS...\n",
    "\n",
    "The key here for the first part of the task is in the name RMS, i.e. 'root of mean of squares' – numpy has methods for each of these, though this case is small enough that you can get away with explicitly doing the calculation yourself within a double-loop, as shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "It also means you can get away with doing it all in a single line, as shown below, despite the potential for creation of large 2d temporary arrays (from `r**2` or `np.square(r)`).\n",
    "\n",
    "An effective compromise, if array dimensions could conceivably become large, is to use methods that work on the whole of a single dimension (or two, if not too large), with loop(s) for the remaining dimension(s) – as demonstrated in code below for calculation of `rms2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some common mistakes turned up here, though:  \n",
    "– dividing by the wrong dimension (i.e. `nx` instead of `nt`);  \n",
    "– forgetting to include the divisor within the sqrt (i.e. dividing the sqrt of sum by `nt` rather than by, effectively, `sqrt(nt)`);  \n",
    "– forgetting to divide at all (i.e. just summing).  \n",
    "All three of above would mean that the plot afterwards shows the expected shape, just with the wrong magnitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### • Description of pattern...\n",
    "\n",
    "I was expecting a little more than just \"it looks like an interference pattern\", or \"it oscillates\"...!\n",
    "\n",
    "A few key points:  \n",
    "– it has oscillations / peaks & troughs,  \n",
    "– with higher peaks & lower troughs nearer the middle,  \n",
    "– and it heads down to zero towards the edges.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Could also mention a couple of other small observations about the pattern (though parts of below could easily end up included within the next section, i.e. differences compared with the usual optical experiment):  \n",
    "– it's not quite symmetric, having slightly higher peaks & troughs on the left side;  \n",
    "– the width of the oscillations increases slightly further from the middle;  \n",
    "– as it tails off towards zero near the edges, there are slight 'ripples' in the pattern;  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### • The double-slit experiment...\n",
    "\n",
    "I think everyone recognised the similarity with Young's well-known optical experiment that demonstrated the wave-like nature of light.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, nearly everyone recognised the main difference, i.e. the asymmetry, and that it's due to the gradient in `c`, the propagation speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned in the previous section, there are some other observations about the pattern here which are different from the usual double-slit interference pattern, and I reserved a couple of bonus marks for any other interesting and relevant insights about this – especially for offering some thoughts why it might behave in such ways (and perhaps even suggesting how the simulation could be changed so that some of these behaviours might change, or to test those thoughts).\n"
